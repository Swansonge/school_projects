# school_projects
A collection of code from various classes I've taken. Each folder contains a README file that provides a brief description of what the class was about. The projects for each class have descriptions of what each program does in the code.

Here are the languages and development environments used for each class:
Applications Programming - C, Visual Studio;
Circuits 1 Lab - Matlab;
Circuits 2 Lab - Matlab;
Data Structures - C++, Visual Studio;
Electronics 1 Lab - Matlab;
Engineering Differential Equations - Matlab;
Microprocessors 1 - Assembly, MPLAB X IDE;
Microprocessors 2 - C, MPLAB X IDE;
